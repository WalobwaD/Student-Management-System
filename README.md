<h1 align="center">Student Management System</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

- This is a full-stack application that allows users to create, read, update, and suspend/delete student data. The application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The application's backend (Nodets) is deployed on Render while the frontend is deployed on Vercel (React).

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

- This application was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). React was used to build the frontend of the application while Node.js was used to build the backend. MongoDB was used as the database for the application. The application is deployed on Render and Vercel. The main gist of the application is to allow users to create, read, update, and suspend/delete student data.
  
-  The backend has important middlewares for the admin and class monitors registered in the application that was to be implemented which are: 
   -  The admin && monitor can view all the students in the database and can also view the profile of each student. 
   -  The admin && monitor can also update and suspend/delete the student data.
   -  Students who are not admins or class monitors can only view other student's profiles and their profiles.
  
<h2>Cloning and running the App Locally</h2>

- Get guidance from the specific README files in the client and server folders.
- Backend instructions:
